My research investigates how built environments interact with individuals across space and time.

### Research Interest:

- **Human–Environment Coupling**. Understanding how environmental conditions are perceived, mediated, and dynamically negotiated between occupants and built systems.

- **Exposure and Health**. Quantifying time-structured exposure received at the individual level, and examining exposure and response heterogeneity.

- **Computational Design**. Developing quantitative and algorithmic frameworks that integrate environmental performance and human behavior into environment design processes.

### Current Focus

- My current work centers on modeling **individual exposure history** within complex built environments, including time-resolved exposure trajectories, inter-individual exposure variability, exposure–response heterogeneity, and population-conditional expected exposure fields.
- The overarching aim is to support cross-scale, health-relevant risk analysis.

**From environmental supply metrics to risk-aligned individual exposure evaluation.**
