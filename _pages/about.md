I study individual exposure in the built environment.

My research focuses on the shift  
from environmental supply metrics  
to time-structured exposure history at the individual level.

Current work includes:

- Light Exposure History (LEH)  
- Exposure–response heterogeneity  
- Expected Received Exposure (ERE)  
- Grid-based exposure field modeling  

Methodologically, I combine wearable sensing, spatial modeling,  
and statistical learning for cross-scale risk inference.
