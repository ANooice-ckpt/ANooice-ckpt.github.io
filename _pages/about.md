My research investigates how built environments interact with individuals across space and time.

### Research Interest:

- Human–Environment Coupling. Understanding how environmental conditions are perceived, mediated, and dynamically negotiated between occupants and built systems.

- Individual Exposure and Health. Moving beyond aggregate environmental metrics to quantify time-structured exposure received at the individual level, and examining how exposure heterogeneity translates into exposure–response heterogeneity.

- Computational Environmental Intelligence. Developing quantitative and algorithmic frameworks that integrate environmental performance, human behavior, and uncertainty into design and evaluation processes.

### Current Focus

My current work centers on modeling individual exposure history within complex built environments, including:

- Time-resolved exposure trajectories  
- Inter-individual exposure variability  
- Exposure–response heterogeneity  
- Population-conditional expected exposure fields  

The overarching aim is to support cross-scale, health-relevant risk analysis.
