My research investigates how built environments interact with individuals across space and time.

I am broadly interested in three interconnected domains:

**Human–Environment Coupling.**  
Understanding how environmental conditions are perceived, mediated, and dynamically negotiated between occupants and built systems.

**Individual Exposure and Health.**  
Moving beyond aggregate environmental metrics to quantify time-structured exposure received at the individual level, and examining how exposure heterogeneity translates into exposure–response heterogeneity.

**Computational Environmental Intelligence.**  
Developing quantitative and algorithmic frameworks that integrate environmental performance, human behavior, and uncertainty into design and evaluation processes.

### Current Focus

My current work centers on modeling **individual exposure history** within complex built environments.

Rather than evaluating environments solely through supply-side indicators, I develop methods to estimate:

- Time-resolved exposure trajectories  
- Inter-individual exposure variability  
- Exposure–response heterogeneity  
- Population-conditional expected exposure fields  

This work combines sensing, spatial modeling, and statistical inference to support cross-scale health-relevant risk analysis.

**From environmental supply metrics to risk-aligned individual exposure evaluation.**
